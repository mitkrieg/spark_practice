      "compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life,\n",
      "all those his lands Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror; Against\n",
      "the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our King; which had return’d\n",

      "Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle, hot and full, Hath in\n",
      "the skirts of Norway, here and there, Shark’d up a list of lawless\n",
      "resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach\n",
      "in’t; which is no other, As it doth well appear unto our state, But to\n",
      "recover of us by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid\n",
      "lands So by his father lost. And this, I take it, Is the main motive of\n",

      "first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and\n",
      "where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this\n",
      "encompassment and drift of question, That they do know my son, come you\n",
      "more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it. Take you as\n",
      "’twere some distant knowledge of him, As thus, ‘I know his father and\n",

      "Ungart’red, and down-gyved to his ankle, Pale as his shirt, his knees\n",

      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. What said he?\n",
      "\n",

      "falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stay’d he\n",
      "so, At last,—a little shaking of mine arm, And thrice his head thus\n",
      "waving up and down, He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound As it did\n",

      "go, And with his head over his shoulder turn’d He seem’d to find his\n",

      "hard words of late?\n",
      "\n",
      "OPHELIA. No, my good lord; but as you did command, I did repel his\n",

      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and\n",

      "age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the\n",
      "younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King. This must be\n",

      "lord?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Words, words, words.\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. What is the matter, my lord?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Between who?\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. I mean the matter that you read, my lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men\n",
      "have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging\n",
      "thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of\n",
      "wit, together with most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most\n",
      "powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it\n",
      "thus set down. For you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a\n",
      "crab you could go backward.\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. [_Aside._] Though this be madness, yet there is a method\n",
      "in’t.— Will you walk out of the air, my lord?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Into my grave?\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. Indeed, that is out o’ the air. [_Aside._] How pregnant\n",
      "sometimes his replies are! A happiness that often madness hits on,\n",
      "which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I\n",
      "will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him\n",
      "and my daughter. My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave\n",
      "of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more\n",
      "willingly part withal, except my life, except my life, except my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. Fare you well, my lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. These tedious old fools.\n",
      "\n",
      " Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. [_To Polonius._] God save you, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      " [_Exit Polonius._]\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. My honoured lord!\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. My most dear lord!\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,\n",
      "Rosencrantz. Good lads, how do ye both?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. As the indifferent children of the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. Happy in that we are not over-happy; On Fortune’s cap we\n",
      "are not the very button.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Nor the soles of her shoe?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Neither, my lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. Faith, her privates we.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a\n",
      "strumpet. What’s the news?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me\n",
      "question more in particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved\n",
      "at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. Prison, my lord?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Denmark’s a prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Then is the world one.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and\n",
      "dungeons, Denmark being one o’ th’ worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. We think not so, my lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Why, then ’tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or\n",
      "bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Why, then your ambition makes it one; ’tis too narrow for\n",
      "your mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a\n",
      "king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very\n",
      "substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. A dream itself is but a shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality\n",
      "that it is but a shadow’s shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch’d\n",
      "heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I\n",
      "cannot reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. We’ll wait upon you.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my\n",
      "servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully\n",
      "attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at\n",
      "Elsinore?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you.\n",
      "And sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you\n",
      "not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,\n",
      "deal justly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. What should we say, my lord?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there\n",
      "is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not\n",
      "craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for\n",
      "you.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. To what end, my lord?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights\n",
      "of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of\n",
      "our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could\n",
      "charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent\n",
      "for or no.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. [_To Guildenstern._] What say you?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. [_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold\n",
      "not off.\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. My lord, we were sent for.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your\n",
      "discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I\n",
      "have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all\n",
      "custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition\n",
      "that this goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory;\n",
      "this most excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o’erhanging\n",
      "firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it\n",
      "appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of\n",
      "vapours. What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason? How infinite\n",
      "in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable? In action\n",
      "how like an angel? In apprehension, how like a god? The beauty of the\n",
      "world, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this\n",
      "quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither,\n",
      "though by your smiling you seem to say so.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Why did you laugh then, when I said ‘Man delights not me’?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten\n",
      "entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them on the\n",
      "way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. He that plays the king shall be welcome,—his Majesty shall have\n",
      "tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target;\n",
      "the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in\n",
      "peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a’ th’\n",
      "sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall\n",
      "halt for’t. What players are they?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Even those you were wont to take such delight in—the\n",
      "tragedians of the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation\n",
      "and profit, was better both ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late\n",
      "innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the\n",
      "city? Are they so followed?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. No, indeed, they are not.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there\n",
      "is, sir, an ayry of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of\n",
      "question, and are most tyrannically clapped for’t. These are now the\n",
      "fashion, and so berattle the common stages—so they call them—that many\n",
      "wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come\n",
      "thither.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. What, are they children? Who maintains ’em? How are they\n",
      "escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?\n",
      "Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common\n",
      "players—as it is most like, if their means are no better—their writers\n",
      "do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the\n",
      "nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a\n",
      "while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to\n",
      "cuffs in the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Is’t possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Do the boys carry it away?\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and\n",
      "those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty,\n",
      "forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.\n",
      "’Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy\n",
      "could find it out.\n",
      "\n",
      " [_Flourish of trumpets within._]\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. There are the players.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The\n",
      "appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you\n",
      "in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I tell you must show\n",
      "fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You\n",
      "are welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.\n",
      "\n",
      "GUILDENSTERN. In what, my dear lord?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I\n",
      "know a hawk from a handsaw.\n",
      "\n",
      " Enter Polonius.\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. Well be with you, gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",

      "great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "ROSENCRANTZ. Happily he’s the second time come to them; for they say an\n",
      "old man is twice a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark\n",
      "it.—You say right, sir: for a Monday morning ’twas so indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. My lord, I have news to tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in\n",
      "Rome—\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. The actors are come hither, my lord.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Buzz, buzz.\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. Upon my honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Then came each actor on his ass—\n",
      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,\n",
      "history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,\n",
      "tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene\n",
      "individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus\n",
      "too light, for the law of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.\n",

      "HAMLET. Why— ’One fair daughter, and no more, The which he loved\n",

      "\n",
      "POLONIUS. What follows then, my lord?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. Why, As by lot, God wot, and then, you know, It came to pass,\n",
      "as most like it was. The first row of the pious chanson will show you\n",
      "more. For look where my abridgement comes.\n",
      "\n",
      " Enter four or five Players.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well.\n",
      "Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc’d since I\n",

      "and mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I\n",

      "are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falconers, fly at anything\n",

      "quality. Come, a passionate speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "FIRST PLAYER. What speech, my lord?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAMLET. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or\n",
      "if it was, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the\n",
      "million, ’twas caviare to the general. But it was—as I received it, and\n",
      "others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an\n",
      "excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much\n",
      "modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the\n",
      "lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that\n",
      "might indite the author of affectation, but called it an honest method,\n",
      "as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One\n",
      "speech in it, I chiefly loved. ’Twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and\n",
      "thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it\n",
      "live in your memory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see: _The\n",

      "more dismal. Head to foot Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d With\n",
      "blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, Bak’d and impasted with the\n",
      "parching streets, That lend a tyrannous and a damned light To their\n",
      "vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire, And thus o’ersized with\n",
